/**
 * Quick-fill comment banks for the five free-text remark fields on a
 * SCORED level's (Lower Primary, Upper Primary, JHS) report record -
 * Conduct, Interest, Attitude, Class teacher's remark, Headteacher's
 * remark. Mirrors KG_GENERAL_COMMENT_BANK's pattern exactly (see
 * kgCommentBank.ts): a dropdown offers these as a starting point, but
 * every field stays a normal free-text input underneath, so typing a
 * remark that isn't in this list works exactly as it always has -
 * nothing here is a restriction, only a shortcut.
